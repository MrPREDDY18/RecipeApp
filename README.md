# RecipeApp - A Simple Recipe Management Console Application

## Description

RecipeApp is a user-friendly console application designed to streamline recipe management. With easy input, modification, and organization features, users can effortlessly create culinary delights. Beyond entering details, the app allows for displaying recipes, scaling quantities, resetting measurements, and clearing data. It's the perfect tool for both seasoned chefs and aspiring cooks, offering convenience and efficiency in every culinary adventure.

## Features:
RecipeApp offers a seamless experience for managing recipes, allowing users to input detailed information such as the name, quantity, and unit of each ingredient, as well as the steps to prepare the dish. The Display Recipe feature presents this information in a neatly formatted manner, ensuring clarity and ease of reference.

For added flexibility, RecipeApp enables users to scale the quantities of ingredients in a recipe by a factor of 0.5 (half), 2 (double), or 3 (triple), accommodating different serving sizes or preferences with ease. Should users need to revert to the original measurements, the Reset Quantities option restores the recipe to its initial state.

Furthermore, RecipeApp prioritizes user convenience by offering the Clear All Data functionality, allowing users to easily wipe all entered recipe data from memory when starting fresh is necessary. And when users are done with the application, a simple Exit command seamlessly concludes their session. With RecipeApp, managing recipes becomes not just efficient, but also intuitive and hassle-free.
